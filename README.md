Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe app! This app was built using the React framework and allows users to play a classic game of Tic Tac Toe against the computer. The app features a clean and intuitive interface, as well as responsive design for different screen sizes.

Users can choose to play as X or O, and the app will keep track of their wins and losses. The app also includes a reset button, allowing users to start a new game at any time.

I hope you enjoy playing this fun and simple game. Feel free to leave feedback or suggestions in the comments. Thank you for checking out my Tic Tac Toe app!
